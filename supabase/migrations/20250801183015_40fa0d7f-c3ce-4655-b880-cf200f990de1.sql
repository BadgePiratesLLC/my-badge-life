Look for badges with characters, skulls, totems, or similar designs. Be flexible with naming - badges might have completely different names than the query. Focus on: 1) Shape/design similarity (character, totem, skull), 2) Green PCB color, 3) Electronic components, 4) Conference/hacker context. Return JSON: {name, maker, year, description, price, url, found: true/false}. Include the full Tindie URL in the url field. If you find ANY electronic badge that could visually match a green character/totem PCB design, set found=true.'
